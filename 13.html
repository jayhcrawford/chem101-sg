Like dissolves like, substances with similar types of intermolecular forces dissolve in each other

When a solute dissolves in a solvent, there are solvent-solute interactions, solvent-solvent interactions, and solute-solute interactions. Breaking these interactions requires enthalpy. The forces need to be comparable in strength for the solution to occur.

**Dissolution** - *(definition)* - The attractive forces between Ions and water (ion-dipole) overcomes the lattice energy by solvation

**Solvation** - *(definition)* - The clustering of solvent molecules around a solute molecule. If the solvent is H<sub>2</sub>O, it is called hydration
 > The intermolecular forces are strong enough to break the lattice energy and prevent reconnection
 > The clustering of solvent

***Lattice Energy***
Anything that is a small atom, and therefore electrons are easily attracted to its nucleus, or anything with a large charge, is going to have higher lattice energy

Hydration shells form around ions in aqueous solutions

In order to calculate what it takes to dissolve a substance in water (seperate it into its constituent parts), we need to know

In order to dissolve something in a solution, the Î”H needs to be greater than zero. 

By heating a system in order to aid in dissolving, we are adding energy into the dissolution.

In order to determine if a solution is saturated you need to set up a ratio. In order for a solution to be supersaturated, the solute must be more than saturated and described as completely dissolved.

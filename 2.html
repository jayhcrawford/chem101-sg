# Physical vs Chemical Properties

*Are these properties determined without changing the identity of the substance?*
 
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 2em; box-shadow: 5px 5px black"> 
 
 > ***YES*** - Physical properties

 - Then, the fundamental question of physical properties is, 

     "Does the property depend on the amount of substance?"


<div style="border: 1px solid lightgrey; margin: 2em; box-shadow: 5px 5px lightgrey"> 
 
> **YES** - Extensive physical property (Mass, Volume, Length, Shape)

> **NO** - Intensive physical property (Color, Melting Point, Boiling Point, Density)

</div>

</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 2em; box-shadow: 5px 5px black"> 

 > ***NO*** - Chemical properties
 > - key takeaway here, chemical properties are determined by changing the identity of a substance. For example, to determine the property of combustibility, one must burn the substance.

# Mixtures vs. Compounds
 
 - **Compounds** are formed by chemically combining two or more elements in a fixed ratio; these molecules are held together by covalent or ionic bonds.


 - **Mixtures** are created by physically mixing two substances together where each component can be easily physically seperated.

 - **Homogenous** - a mixture that has the same proportions of its components throughout a given sample. 
 - **Heterogenous** - a mixture of two or more substances that are not evenly mixed and have different properties throughout.

**Ions**

# Kinetic and Potential Energy

# Nomenclature
# Law of Conservation of Mass
 - Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 discovery that mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions.

# Law of Definite Proportions
 - states that a given chemical compound always contains the same elements in the exact same proportions by mass

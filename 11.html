### Degrees of Freedom 
- **Translational Freedom** - *(definition)* - The ability to move from on position in space to another
 > gases have translational freedom

- **Rotational Freedom** - *(definition)* - the ablity to reorient the particles direction in space
 > gases and liquids have rotational freedom


- **Vibrational Freedom** - *(definition)* - the ability tto oscillate about a particular point in space
 > solids, liquids, and gases have vibrational freedom (think heat)

### States and Degrees of Freedom 
- the molecules in a **gas** have complete freedom of motion
- the molecules in a **solid** are locked in place
- the molecules in a **liquid** have limited freedom

### Phase Transitions

<img style="width: 50%" src="https://jayhcrawford-webimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chem101-host/Phase_change_-_en.svg.png"/>

### Phase Diagrams

- **note** - for most substances, freezing point increases as pressure increases
- the line in between a liquid and a gas is the **vapor pressure** curve
- the line in between a solid and a liquid is the **fusion** curve
- the line in between a solid and a gas is the **sublimation** curve
- right on the line, a substance is simultaneosly in both phases

- **the morphic forms** of ice exist at higher pressure, this is similar to the way that CaCO<sub>3</sub> is the chemical composition of both chalk and marble




# Intermolecular forces
 - Intramolecular forces are between atoms
 - Intermolecular forces are between molecules


## Types of Intermolecular Forces
 - Neutral Molecules
 > - London Dispersion
 - Dipole-dipole
 - Hydrogen bonding

## Ions
 > -Iond-dipole force



London Dispersion Forces: Also called induced dipole forces. Instantaneous dipole created within atom or molecule created by the movement of electrons around the nucleus ***All molecules have LDF***

Dipole-Dipole Forces: The attractive force between molecules due to the existence of an overall dipole moment. ***Polar molecules*** have dipole-dipole forces

Hydrogen Bonding - The attractive force between Hydrogen and its bonds with O, N, or F.


There is a really good chart that describes the step by step process of how to determine IMF forces in the IMF notes


A polar molecule will dissolve in a polar solvent

Ion-Dipole attraction is the force that we call "dissolving". The ions from an ionic compound are attracted the the dipoles of a polar molecule.

There is a really good chart that describes the interaction of molecules or ions

- The **weaker** the attractive forces between molecules, the less energy required to vapourize. OR. The weaker the intermolecular forces, the faster the evaporation.

- Liquids that evaporate easily are said to be volatile

- The **fewer** intermolecular forces, the **lower** the boiling point will be.

- The lighter the molecule, the easier it will be to boil. For example, Carbon is lighter than Germanium and equivalent molecules will have a big difference in boiling point. Both mass and radius are relevant here.

- Substances with hydrogen bonding generally have higher boiling points. Hydrogen bonding is an extremely strong force.

# Regarding polarity

- Like dissolves like.
- When a nonpolar substance meets a polar substance, they are immiscible.
- hydrophilic groups = OH, CHO, C=O, COOH, NH<sub>2</sub>, Cl
- nonpolar molecules dissolve in nonpolar solvents
- hydrophobic = C-H, C-C

- Many molecules have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Solubility becomes a competition between the attraction of the polar groups and the nonpolar groups with their own kind.

- Substances that are very similar, having the same set of forces, are likely to be miscible.



 - Be confident on the different names for the different types of transitions
 - Any substance can boil, water boils at around 95 C at high altitudes in Colorado
 - You need to know the Pressure to know what the boiling and melting points of a substance are
 - If the questions uses "Normal" then that means the substance at 1 atm.
 - **Triple Point** *(definition)* - When all three states of matter exist simultaneously. There is only one temperature for a substance where this can happen.
 - **Freezing curve** and **Fusion curve** are interchangeable. This is the point at which something becomes a solid, or a solid vapourizes.
 - Whenever you're on the line of a phase diagram, you are in both states simultaneously. (ex. Solid and Gas at the same time)
 - The **critical point** on a phase diagram is the point at which a material becomes a supercritical fluid
 - 

# Properties of Liquids


- **Viscosity** *(definition)* - resistance of a liquid to flow; depends on attractive forces between molecules and structural features which cause greater interaction

- **Surface Tension** - The energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a unit amount

- **Meniscus** *(definition)* - The curving of the surface of a liquid in a thin tube is due to the competition in between adhesive and cohesive forces

- **Supercritical fluid** *(definition)* - when something is simultaneously gas and liquid. At some temperature the meniscus between the liquid and vapor disappears
- Be prepared to explain what is happening on a phase diagram

## Vapour Pressure
- Vapour pressure changes with IMF forces and temperature
- Vapour pressure involves a dynamic equillibrium    liquid <---> gas
- Changing the containers volume disturbs the equilibrium
 > When the volume is increased, the rate of vaporization increases. When the size of the container decreases, the rate of vaporization decreases.

- Volatile vs non-volatile
- Clausius - Clapeyron Equation - In general, the higher the temperature, the weaker the intermolecular forces, and therefore the higher the vapour pressure

***Input Clausius - Clapeyron Equation***

<img style="width: 50%" src="https://jayhcrawford-webimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chem101-host/clausius-clapeyron-eqtn.svg"/>

- **R** = 8.314 J/mol*K
- **T** = Kelvin
- **P** = vapor pressure

### Heat of Fusion
- the amount of energy required to melt one mole of a solid; sometimes called **enthalpy of fusion**
- **heat of crystallization** is the negative heat of fusion
-  ΔH<sub>sublimation</sub> = ΔH<sub>fusion</sub> + ΔH<sub>vaporization</sub>
